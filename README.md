# Inflections
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mmucklo/inflections.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mmucklo/inflections)

These are a set of base inflections for use with an inflector library (such as [mmucklo/inflect](https://github.com/mmucklo/inflect).

## Layout

Inflections live under src/(Locale)

There's one file for Singular, Plural, and Uninflectables

## Design

Inflections are purposefully set as public static variables so that they can be manipulated (hint: extended, etc.) prior to being used.
